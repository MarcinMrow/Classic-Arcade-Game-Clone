# Front-End Nanodegree Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

- It is a real-life and complete browser-based arcade game. 
- Created for [**Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program**](https://eu.udacity.com/)

For detailed instructions on project specification, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

## How The Game Works

1. In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). 
2. The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies. 
3. The player can move left, right, up and down (use arrow keys).
4. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. 
5. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square.
6. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.

Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.
